This project is designed to create an inventory system in C++ using object-
oriented programming. The system will enable the user to store and track
information about products, including their quantity, price, and other details. The
technologies used for this project include C++ programming language, and
database management systems such as MySQL. Additionally, techniques such as
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Structured Query Language (SQL) will
be used to create an efficient and robust inventory system
